    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we shall look at how **Variance** of a random variable is used to calculate **Covariance** and **Correlation**, two key measures used in Statistics for finding the relationships between random variables. These measures help us identify the degree to which two set of data tend to deviate from their expected value (i.e. mean), in a similar way. Based on these measures, we can identify if two variable are dependent on each other, and to what extend. This lesson will help you develop a conceptual understanding, necessary calculations and some precautions while using these measures. \n",

    "## What is Variance ($\\sigma^2$)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we talk about covariance , it is imperative that we get some idea around **Variance** of a random variable. Variance refers to the __spread of a data set__. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __Variance is a measure used to quantify how much a random variable deviates from its mean value__. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we calculate variance, we are essentially asking, \"__Given the relationship of all given data points, how much distant from mean do we expect the next data point to be?__\"  This \"distance\" is called the **error term**, and it's what variance is measuring. \n",
    "\n",
    "Variance is shown using notatioin $\\sigma^2$. Previously, we have seen $\\sigma$ as a measure of standard deviation within a given dataset. Remember standard deviation is also a measure of spread of data. __Variance is simply the square of standard deviation (Or we could say standard deviation is is the square root of variance)__. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a simple application of this measure could be associating probabilities with predicted future events in a market research activity, identifying them as \"very likely\" or \"unlikely\" etc. Most people are risk averse, in that they wish to minimize the amount of risk they must endure to earn a certain level of expected return. If investors were indifferent to risk, they would not be influenced by the differences between stock A and stock B above, whereas the risk-averse investor would clearly prefer stock A. Therefore, most people want to know the range or dispersion(spread/deviation as we termed it earlier) of possible outcomes, as well as the likelihood of certain outcomes occurring. Variance measure is a great way to find all of the possible values and likelihoods that a random variable can take within a given range defined by the underlying data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following graphs for Conglomo, Inc. and Bilco, Inc. These graphs show the theoretical frequency distributions of the monthly returns for each firm's common stock as though the returns were normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"var.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Conglomo's distribution of returns is more concentrated than Bilco's, as illustrated by Conglomo's relatively wider bell curve. A more concentrated distribution is defined as having a smaller standard deviation. The distribution curve appears higher, steeper, and narrower because more observations are occurring close to the expected return. Bilco's distribution is rather flat, reflecting that its returns are less concentrated, or more dispersed, than those of Conglomo Inc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreting Variance \n",
    "\n",
    "A variance value of zero represents that all of the values within a data set are identical, while all variances that are not equal to zero will come in the form of positive numbers. The larger the variance, the more spread in the data set. A large variance means that the numbers in a set are far from the mean and each other. A small variance means that the numbers are closer together in value. \n",
    "### How to Calculate Variance? \n",
    "\n",
    "Variance is calculated by:\n",
    "1. Taking the differences between each element in a data set and the mean, \n",
    "2. Squaring those differences to give it a positive value\n",
    "3. Dividing the sum of the resulting squares by the number of values in the set.\n",

This removes bias from the estimation, as it prohibits the researcher from underestimating the population variance.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we know what variance is what quantity it measures, imagine calculating variance of two random variables to get some idea on how they change together (or stay the same) considering all included values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Stats, If we are trying to figure out how two random variables tend to **vary** together, we are effectively talking about **Covariance** between these variables. Covariance provides an insight into how two variables are __related__ to one another. \n",
    "\n",

    "> The measure of how two random variables in a data set will __change together__. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance (and correlation, as we shall see later) is a common technique used in multiple areas of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key application of covariance is to check for the extent of linear relationship between two variables. A positive covariance means that the two variables at hand are positively related, and they move in the same direction, whereas a negative covariance means that the variables are inversely related, or that they move in opposite directions. A zero value of covariance would effectively highlight \"no linear relation\". This forms the foundations for regression analysis as we shall see later. \n",
    "\n",
    " The covariance between variables in a data set can help reveal a lower dimension space that can still capture the majority of the variance in the data, i.e.,  it may be possible to combine variables that have  high covariance without losing too much information. This measure provides foundations for dimension reduction, similarity based feature extraction. Later in the course, we shall look at PCA (Principle Component Analysis), a common technique for bringing a complex dataset into a lower dimension space for analysis. PCA uses Covariance to identify such lower dimensions. In the example below, we can see how PCA allows us to calculate new __linear__ features (called components) for a 3 dimensional dataset, and analyze it in 2 dimensions. \n",

During data analysis, covariance measure can not be directly used in data comparison as it different experiments may contain underlying data, measured in different units. For this, we need to normalize this degree of variation into a standard unit, with interpretable results independent of the units of data. We achieve this with a derived normalized measure, called correlation. \n",

For example, an e-retailer wants to compare a number of secondary success events (e.g., file downloads, product detail page views, internal search click-throughs, etc.) with weekly web revenue. They can quickly identify internal search click-throughs as having the highest correlation, which may indicate an area for optimization.\n",
